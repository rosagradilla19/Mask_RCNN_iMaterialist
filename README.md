# Mask_RCNN_iMaterialist


This project involves a clothing dataset with the goal of introducing a novel fine-grained segmentation task by 
joining forces between the fashion and computer vision communities. The proposed task unifies both 
categorization and segmentation of rich and complete apparel attributes, an important step toward real-world applications.
